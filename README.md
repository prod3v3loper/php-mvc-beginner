# PHP MVC Beginner

Model View Controller for beginners to bring the function way closer. 

This MVC is very simple and without a htaccess that would direct all calls to a file or would allow a mod_rewrite.
There are no safety functions or validations in this example, it represents the simplest form of MVCs there

Below you will find more examples and tutorials on a MVC that you can find here in the near future.
